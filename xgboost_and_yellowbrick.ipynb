    "# Visualizing High-Performance Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and Yellowbrick\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we'll explore how to evaluate the performance of a gradient boosting classifier from the [`xgboost` library](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) on the [poker hand dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand) using visual diagnostic tools from [`Yellowbrick`](http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/). Even though Yellowbrick is designed to work with [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), it turns out that it works well with any machine learning library that provides a sklearn wrapper module.\n",

    "## What is Boosting?    \n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised machine learning, [gradient boosting]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) is an additive training technique for iteratively ensembling weak models into stronger ones. Traditional tree-based methods allow us to scale complexity with increasingly deep trees and more complex branching, but have a tendency to overfit to the training data. Gradient boosting enables us to build complex models using ensembles of shallow trees, which individually have low variance and high bias, but together can incrementally decrease bias via gradient descent. A preliminary, naive model is fit, its error is computed, and the error is used to train the next model, and so on. In this way, the algorithm aims to optimize the loss function over function space by iteratively fitting models that point in the negative gradient direction. Gradient boosting models are also invariant to scaling inputs, meaning that they do not require careful feature normalization, as do some models (like k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when I am prototyping a machine learning application, I leverage the Scikit-Learn API to compare many estimators and a few different hyperparameters. Because I work in a biweekly scrum cycle context, I'm less concerned with optimatization (at least at the outset), and more focused on proving out whether or not a new dataset is well-suited to prediction. Scikit-Learn does have [an implementation of gradient boosting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html), but in this post, I'll be using [`xgboost`](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), which provides implementations of parallel tree boosting and also has a sklearn wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently, there are an increasing number of Python libraries that expose convenient Scikit-Learn wrappers for custom estimators (e.g. Gensim, Keras, etc). This means that they can be used inside Scikit-Learn [pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) (if you've never experimented with pipelines or feature unions, here's [great post](http://zacstewart.com/2014/08/05/pipelines-of-featureunions-of-pipelines.html) by Zac Stewart on leveraging them in your ML workflow).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the Scikit-Learn implementation (which tend to be geared towards small-to-medium-sized datasets), `xgboost` is unique in that it is written to scale seamlessly to large datasets and a Spark context (it evolved out of a [research project](http://dmlc.cs.washington.edu/xgboost.html) by [Tianqi Chen](https://github.com/tqchen) and [Carlos Guestrin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/)). This enables us to quickly compare not only the standard Scikit-Learn estimators but also ones that may more easily scale, should we find good preliminary success with our prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Yellowbrick?    \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Yellowbrick](http://www.scikit-yb.org) library is a new Python visualization package that extends the Scikit-Learn API to incorporate visual diagnostics into machine learning -- and has over the last years become an essential part of my own ML workflow. It's my go-to tool for determining whether I'm on track through my feature analysis -> model selection -> hyperparameter tuning cycles, and for deciding what to do next based on my current results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand) we'll be exploring in this post is the Poker Hand data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The premise is that given some features of a hand of cards in a poker game, we should be able to predict the type of hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each record in the dataset is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes. The target column describes the hand, with the possibilities being:    \n",
    "\n",
    "    0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand     \n",
    "    1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards     \n",
    "    2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards     \n",
    "    3: Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards     \n",
    "    4: Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps     \n",
    "    5: Flush; five cards with the same suit     \n",
    "    6: Full house; pair + different rank three of a kind     \n",
    "    7: Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards     \n",
    "    8: Straight flush; straight + flush     \n",
    "    9: Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush     \n",
    "    \n",
    "The order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 (one for each suit)."

The ideal point is therefore the top-left corner of the plot: false positives are zero and true positives are one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to another metric, area under the curve (AUC), a computation of the relationship between false positives and true positives. The higher the AUC, the better the model generally is. However, it is also important to inspect the “steepness” of the curve, as this describes the maximization of the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Generalizing “steepness” usually leads to discussions about convexity, which we do not get into here.\n",
